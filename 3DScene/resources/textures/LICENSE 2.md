Textures license
All textures on this site are licensed as CC0.

Here’s an exerpt from the CC0 FAQ page to clarify:

Once the creator or a subsequent owner of a work applies CC0 to a work, the work is no longer his or hers in any meaningful sense under copyright law. Anyone can then use the work in any way and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, subject to other laws and the rights others may have in the work or how the work is used. Think of CC0 as the “no rights reserved” option. CC0 is a useful tool for clarifying that you do not claim copyright in a work anywhere in the world.
In other words, these textures no longer belong to me. They belong to the public.

Because you might feel the need to ask anyway:

You can use the textures for any purpose, including commercial.
You do not need to give credit or attribution when using them (although it is appreciated).
You can redistribute them (share them around or include them when sharing your own project).
The only thing you can’t do is claim to be the author of the textures. Since they are Public Domain, no one owns them.
